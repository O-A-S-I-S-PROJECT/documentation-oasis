Despite the features present in the pre-trained model and its backend, it still did not fully meet the needs of the project. As a result, we had to make several modifications, including creating an API and reorganizing the code architecture. All these adaptations became necessary due to the lack of data in the knowledge base at that time, which was not aligned with the final goal of the project.

We also chose to use a pre-trained model and a foot-ready base because of the time, to which it is urgent and constant.
