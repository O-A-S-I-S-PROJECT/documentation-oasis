# Summary Changes 

The **OASIS** project had as its starting point the privateGPT code, which underwent significant modifications to build the desired AI. These modifications involved creating a highly specialized PDF reader and converter tailored to our needs, as well as developing EndPoints using the code base, integrating it with the database and PDF reading system.

Furthermore, we implemented containerization of the application in Docker, aiming to improve the performance of artificial intelligence, in addition to establishing efficient control of errors and bugs to ensure the proper functioning of the system.

For data management, we chose to use ChromaDB for intelligence operation, leveraging its advanced capabilities. In addition, we chose MySQL for the organization and external distribution of the application, ensuring efficiency in data management.

The interface between the backend and the frontend is provided through an API, FastAPI being our choice due to its remarkable performance, efficiency and a simple syntax that simplifies development and maintenance.

As far as frontend is concerned, we decided to adopt the Next.js language. This choice was motivated by its growing market adoption, the inclusion of features such as Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and the excellent performance it offers. In addition, Next.js provides a user-friendly development experience, is fully open source, and has a large community of users, making it a valuable source of content and support on the internet.
