# Summary Changes 

The **OASIS** project had as its starting point the privateGPT code, which underwent significant modifications to build the desired AI. These modifications involved creating a highly specialized PDF reader and converter tailored to our needs, as well as developing EndPoints using the code base, integrating it with the database and PDF reading system.

Furthermore, we implemented containerization of the application in Docker, aiming to improve the performance of artificial intelligence, in addition to establishing efficient control of errors and bugs to ensure the proper functioning of the system.



## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
