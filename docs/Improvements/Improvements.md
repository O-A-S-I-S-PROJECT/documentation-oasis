For this project we had 6 months of development, it was a short period for the creation of an artistic intelligence, but it was possible to reach the level where it is now because of the code base and the pre-trained model we use. If we had to do it from scratch we would have to have much more than 6 months, at least 2 years to reach the acceptable and good level.
Our product aimed at data security, productivity and service agility in sectors that detect problems with the coverage of information spread throughout the company and agility in the search for information, was an ambitious challenge for 6 months and an extensive knowledge obtained in a short time.

So here are some suggestions for improvements for this product made for the company:
- A more agile and better trained pre-trained model can be added;
- A template can be created from scratch with only company information such as docupedia;
- Artificial intelligence can be made from scratch with other languages;
- The application can be placed inside a container;
    - Application with Docker would improve many things and avoid many errors;
- use the gpu for better processing of information and data;
- Invest in a companyâ€™s own server(computer) for the demand of users who would use the system;
- Be added voice recognition to ask questions
- Adding other languages and training their responses
